# Real-Estate-Chatbot
In our project to create a chatbot for a real estate company, our team created a chatbot for a real estate company, our team employed state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, supplemented by synthesized data for robust training. This strategic use of synthesized data significantly bolstered the chatbot's comprehension and responsiveness to diverse user queries about property listings, pricing, locations, and other real estate-related information. Recognizing the need for a streamlined user experience, we innovatively integrated an API that seamlessly connected with Google Calendar. This feature empowered users to effortlessly schedule appointments with real estate agents directly through the chatbot interface, enhancing convenience and facilitating smoother interactions between customers and agents.

 **The chatbot considered the three following scenarios:**
 1. Assists users who are interested in buying or renting a property
 2. Helps users who want ot sell their property by providing an estimated listing price
 3. Helps users in finding a real estate agent based on specific criteria
